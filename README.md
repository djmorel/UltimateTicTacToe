# **UltimateTicTacToe**
## Created by Team Tic-Tac & Co
### *by the combined efforts of DJ Morel, Hang Liu, Hussain Valiuddin, Mari Tsunoda, William Willigrod*

# Motivation
We created this app as part of our EC 327 (Intro to Software Engineering) final project at BU. The Motivation behind this app was to take the simple and fun game from our childhood, Tic-Tac-Toe and to create a more strategic and competitive version of the game whoch can be used by adults as well. It is a great way to pass the time and relax.

# Features
The game has both single player and multiplayer options. There is a sweet tune playing in the background during each game as well. The game has a confirm move button to prevent accidental moves which can occur when playing on smaller screens. 

For new users, the game also has a How To Play manual which explains the rules which are pretty simple and build upon the rules of regular Tic-Tac-Toe.

# How to use?

There is a big 3x3 game board which contains 9  smaller 3x3 game boards. These small game boards are just like traditional 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe boards

Player 1 can choose to play in any small board he wants. This move affects which board player 2 can play in
Whichever small box the current player makes a move in, the next player has to play in the same box of the larger board

Once the player wins three in a row in a small board, they mark the board (blue or red)
